# Architecture Constraints

**Contents**

Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of
design and implementation decisions or decision about the development
process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and
are valid for whole organizations and companies.

**Motivation**

Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design
decisions and where they must adhere to constraints. Constraints must
always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

**Form**

| Constraint | Background and / or motivation |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |

| Time / Deadline | The management system needs to be deployed 2 months before the start of the universityâ€™s next semester for smooth migration of the students |
| Legal Compliance (Security) | Data protection and privacy regulations concerning finances and/or user data (GDPR) |
